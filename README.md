# Eurorack Bernoulli Gate

This was obviously inspired by Mutable Instruments Banches.

If you use a different microcontroller, adjust ports and RESOLUTION constant, RESOLUTION should match max. bandwidth of the ADC.
I will try to create a proper schematic as well, also you seed the ports for the leds etc. i think it is fairly self explaining.
I built 2 led-drivers out 2N3904, 3mm Led and a 4.7k Resistor.

Do with this code what you want.
