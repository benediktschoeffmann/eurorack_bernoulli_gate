# Eurorack Bernoulli Gate

This was obviously inspired by Mutable Instruments Banches.

If you use a different microcontroller, adjust ports and ```RESOLUTION``` constant, ```RESOLUTION``` should match max. bandwidth of the ADC.

I tried to make a reasonably understandable schematic, this is as far as i got :)

Basically connect:

* A0 to the potentiometer
* A1 to the input jack
* D2 to the switch
* D3 to left led
* D4 to right led
* D5 to left jack
* D6 to right jack

to an Arduino Nano.

You can do with this code whatever you want.

Ewige Blumenkraft!
